    "# A Chatbot using GPT and a Database\n",

Multiple chatbot instances can be created per chatbot type (e.g. a health coach for user X and user Y, and a learning assistant for user P and user Q). Both, types and instances are stored with and referenced by an ID (e.g. a UUID) in the database.\n",
